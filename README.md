# A pipeline for reproducible human 16S rRNA microbiome analysis

The main goal of this project is to establish feasibility of creating a reproducible pipeline from existing 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing data in humans by providing a full documented pipeline. The first aim of this project is to identify challenges and gaps in 16S rRNA microbiome analysis by conducting a literature review. The second aim of the project is to implement a full documented pipeline to reproduce 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing data analysis in humans. The third aim of the project is to validate the reproducibility of the pipeline by running a public human dataset through it BioProject ID: PRJNA743150, and SRA Study: SRP326567.
